However, these classic findings may not always be present, and symptoms may be atypical or absent in some cases, particularly among elderly patients and pregnant women. Appendicitis cannot be cured via medicine, and early surgery is necessary for effective treatment and prevention of complications such as perforation and peritonitis.

      "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. Diagnosis is suspected clinically and confirmed by imaging (primarily CT). Initial treatment consists of ensuring a reliable airway and maintaining adequate ventilation, oxygenation, and blood pressure. Surgery is often needed in patients with more severe injury to place monitors to track and treat intracranial pressure, decompress the brain if intracranial pressure is increased, or remove intracranial hematomas. In the first few days after the injury, maintaining adequate brain perfusion and oxygenation and preventing complications of altered sensorium are important. Subsequently, many patients require rehabilitation.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Emergency care: Ensure a reliable airway, adequate ventilation, oxygenation, and blood pressure. Monitor for signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as decreased consciousness, bradycardia, or decreased respiratory effort.\n",
      "2. Imaging studies: Primarily use computed tomography (CT) scans to confirm the diagnosis and identify the location and extent of the injury.\n",
      "3. Surgical intervention: May be necessary to relieve increased intracranial pressure, decompress the brain, or remove intracranial hematomas.\n",
      "4. Critical care: Provide mechanical ventilation, manage fluid and electrolyte balance, and monitor for signs of seizures or other complications.\n",
      "5. Neurological supportive care: Include management of fever, pain, and agitation, as well as prevention of further brain injury.\n",
      "6. Rehabilitation: Begin as early as possible and continues for months or years, depending on the severity of the injury and the patient's response to treatment. Rehabilitation goals include improving cognitive, physical, and behavioral function and minimizing long-term disability.\n",

      "batting, and layers 2 and 4 are elastic bandages. The injured limb is elevated above the heart for the first two days in a position that allows gravity to help drain edema fluid and thus minimize swelling. After 48 hours, periodic application of warmth (e.g., a heating pad) for 15 to 20 minutes may relieve pain and speed healing. Immobilization: Immobilization decreases pain and facilitates healing by preventing further injury and is helpful except for very rapidly healing injuries. Joints proximal and distal to the injury should be immobilized. A cast is usually used for fractures or other injuries that require weeks of immobilization. Rarely, swelling under a cast is severe enough to contribute to compartment syndrome (see p. 3213). Sometimes, if severe swelling is likely, a cast (and all padding) is cut open from end to end medially and laterally (bivalved). Patients with casts should be given written instructions to keep the cast dry, never to put an object inside the cast, and to inspect the cast's edges and skin around the cast every day and apply lotion to any red or sore areas. They should also be instructed to pad any rough edges with soft adhesive tape, cloth, or other soft material to prevent the cast's edges from causing skin irritation.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function. Diagnosis is suspected clinically and confirmed by imaging (primarily CT). Initial treatment consists of ensuring a reliable airway and maintaining adequate ventilation, oxygenation, and blood pressure. Surgery is often needed in patients with more severe injury to place monitors to track and treat intracranial pressure, decompress the brain if intracranial pressure is increased, or remove intracranial hematomas. In the first few days after the injury, maintaining adequate brain perfusion and oxygenation and preventing complications of altered sensorium are important. Subsequently, many patients require rehabilitation. In the US, as in much of the world, TBI is a common cause of death and disability. Causes include motor vehicle crashes and other transportation-related causes (eg, bicycle crashes, collisions with pedestrians), falls (especially in older adults and young children), assaults, and sports activities. Pathology Structural changes from head injury may be gross or microscopic, depending on the mechanism and forces involved. Patients with less severe injuries may have no gross structural damage. Clinical manifestations vary markedly in severity and consequences. Injuries are commonly categorized as open or closed. Open injuries involve penetration of the scalp and skull (and usually the meninges and underlying brain tissue). They typically involve bullets or sharp objects, but a skull fracture with overlying laceration due to severe blunt force is also considered an open injury. Closed injuries typically occur when the head is struck, strikes an object, or is shaken violently, causing rapid brain acceleration and deceleration.\n",

      "batting, and layers 2 and 4 are elastic bandages. The injured limb is elevated above the heart for the first 2 days in a position that allows gravity to help drain edema fluid and thus minimize swelling. After 48 h, periodic application of warmth (eg, a heating pad) for 15 to 20 min may relieve pain and speed healing. Immobilization: Immobilization decreases pain and facilitates healing by preventing further injury and is helpful except for very rapidly healing injuries. Joints proximal and distal to the injury should be immobilized. A cast is usually used for fractures or other injuries that require weeks of immobilization. Rarely, swelling under a cast is severe enough to contribute to compartment syndrome (see p. 3213). Sometimes, if severe swelling is likely, a cast (and all padding) is cut open from end to end medially and laterally (bivalved). Patients with casts should be given written instructions: • To keep the cast dry • Never to put an object inside the cast • To inspect the cast's edges and skin around the cast every day and apply lotion to any red or sore areas • To pad any rough edges with soft adhesive tape, cloth, or other soft material to prevent the cast's edges The Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 323.
